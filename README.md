# NestNotes

Simple app for managing simple notes. Created for learning purposes. 

Recently, I realized that all the applications written in Express.js that I have had to work with were terribly writtenâ€”just one big spaghetti code mess. All the logic, database queries, authentication, and other functionalities are crammed into bloated request handlers. It's painfull to watch and more painfull to work with. Perhaps there are well-written applications in Express.js somewhere, but I haven't been fortunate enough to come across them.

That's why I decided to find some tool in TypeScript that would help me (and my colleagues) replace the outdated Express.js with something new and more structured, such as NestJS. Therefore, this is my first attempt with this toy application for creating an API.


## Start

```bash
# 1) install node modules
# 2) start database
make start

# 3) start application
make app_start

```
